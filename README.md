## ARP Scanner with Scapy

This Python script utilizes the powerful `scapy` library to perform ARP scans on a specified IP address range. The script prompts the user to input an IP address and range, validates the input, and then conducts the ARP scan using `scapy.arping()`.

### Features:
- Uses `scapy` library for efficient network packet manipulation.
- Validates user input against a regular expression pattern.
- Displays an ASCII art header for a visually appealing interface.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have `scapy` installed (`pip install scapy`).
3. Run the script and follow the prompts to enter the IP address range.
